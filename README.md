Creating a professional portfolio - Module 2 Challenge

In this challenge I created the start of what will be my Professional Portfolio. 

<ul>The portfolio has a developer name, avatar, and links to sections of: About Me, My Work, and Contact Me.</ul>
<ul>When the navigation links are clicked, it takes you to the corresponding section.</ul>
<ul>When clicking on the My Work link, it takes you to titled images of applications.</ul>
<ul>The first application is larger than the following. </ul>
<ul>When clicking on the applications, it redirects to another site.</ul>
<ul>When the page is resized, the layout is responsive to different viewports.</ul>
